# The FractalDNA package

Geometries for use in molecularDNA can be generated yourself, or with the
help of the [FractalDNA](https://github.com/natl/fractaldna) package in Python.

The FractalDNA package (see the documentation [here](https://natl.github.io/fractaldna/))
provides Python methods for building DNA segments that can be joined together
by the molecularDNA application, as well as assembling geometries.

FractalDNA can be installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip install fractaldna
```
